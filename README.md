# Geoelectromagnetism
This is a repository for my University course on Geoelectromagnetism. I implemented the VES method, in MATLAB, for finding resistivity of different surface layers .

Potential Array calculations were made using the methods listed below:  
  *  Short Normal Logging
  *  Long Normal Logging

Gradient Array calculations were made using the normal logging methods for different distances.
