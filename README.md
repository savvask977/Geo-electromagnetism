# Geoelectromagnetism
This is a repository for my University course on Geoelectromagnetism. I implemented the VES method, in MATLAB, in order to find the resistivity of different surface layers and the potential at each level. The results demonstrate how resistivities and potentials change as we move deeper into the earth's surface. Two models were developed and simulated for this project, with one having a simple structure and the other a complex one. The first consists of some layers without any repeating layer among them and the second one consists of multiple layers and a repeating shale layer between every two layers. The reason the shale layers were added in the second model was to examine how the resistivity changes and adapts as we progress from higher resistivity to lower and then higher again.

Potential Array calculations were made using the methods listed below:  
  *  Short Normal Logging
  *  Long Normal Logging

Gradient Array calculations were made using the normal logging methods for different distances.
